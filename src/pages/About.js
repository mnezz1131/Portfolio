            Software Engineer/Web developer transferring skills from years of Accounting experience to the coding world. I have earned my certificate in Full Stack Development from General Assembly boot camp, with curriculum that focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node Js, React, Ruby, Rails as well as others.  Attention to detail and problem solving skills translate well from Accounting to web development.  Being a  creative team member and seeing the design aspects and  coding come together is extremely gratifying and fulfilling and  motivates me.  I know how to thrive in a team environment,  working as part of a small Finance section where we had to cover for each other.  Iâ€™m enthusiastic about the opportunities for constant learning and growth in the burgeoning field of full stack development.
